# EXCESS 3 TO BINARY CONVERTER

xcess-3, 3-excess[1][2][3] or 10-excess-3 binary code (often abbreviated as XS-3,[4] 3XS[1] or X3[5][6]), shifted binary[7] or Stibitz code[1][2][8][9] (after George Stibitz,[10] who built a relay-based adding machine in 1937[11][12]) is a self-complementary binary-coded decimal (BCD) code and numeral system. It is a biased representation. Excess-3 code was used on some older computers as well as in cash registers and hand-held portable electronic calculators of the 1970s, among other uses.
