A Gray code is an encoding of numbers so that adjacent numbers have a single digit differing by 1
Gray codes are used in the general sequence of hardware-generated binary numbers. 
These numbers cause ambiguities or errors when the transition from one number to its successive is done.
This code simply solves this problem by changing only one bit when the transition is between numbers is done.


steps to convert binary code to gray
                       MSB of gray is same as that of the binary
                       The nth bit is the exor the nth and n+1th bit
                       
                       
                       Here is the tcl console result of our binary to gray converter rlt code
