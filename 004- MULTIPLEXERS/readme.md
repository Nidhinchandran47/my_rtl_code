Multiplexing means transmitting a large number of information units over a smaller number of channels or line.
A digital multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects binary informations from one of many input line ans direct to a single output. 
There are 2 power n input lines for an n select lines.

Here i am implimenting 4 to 1 multiplexer in 4 format 

         1 gate level
         2 case statement
         3 conditional statement
         4 if else statement
                                                         
|    S1   |   S0   |   output   |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
|    0    |    0   |      A     |
|    0    |    1   |      B     |
|    1    |    0   |      C     |
|    1    |    1   |      D     |
