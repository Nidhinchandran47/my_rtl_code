The half adder is used to add only two numbers. To overcome this problem, the full adder was developed. 
The full adder is used to add three 1-bit binary numbers A, B, and carry C. 
The full adder has three input states and two output states i.e., sum and carry.
This is the basic block of n bit parallel adder.

|   A   |   B   | Carry in |  SUM  | Carry out |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|   0   |   0   |    0     |   0   |     0     |
|   0   |   0   |    1     |   1   |     0     |
|   0   |   1   |    0     |   1   |     0     |
|   0   |   1   |    1     |   0   |     1     |
|   1   |   0   |    0     |   1   |     0     |
|   1   |   0   |    1     |   0   |     1     |
|   1   |   1   |    0     |   0   |     1     |
|   1   |   1   |    1     |   1   |     1     |
